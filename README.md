# course-video-download
Download video lectures from a UiO course.

To use it, first run `scrape_for_courses.py`, then run `main.py` with the courses you want to download lectures from as arguments. For example, like this: `python main.py STK1110 MAT3110`. It is barely tested, and probably has lots of errors. It also only downloads videos from the fall of 2020, but this can be easily changed.
